# Welcome to the LIT Secure and Correct Systems Lab! 

The **LIT Secure and Correct Systems Lab** is a cross-institute, interdisciplinary research platform, founded in 2019 by several JKU institutes and with support from the state of Upper Austria. In 2021, the new [Secure Systems Group](https://www.jku.at/en/lit-secure-and-correct-systems-lab/secure-systems-group/), chaired by Stefan Rass became the latest addition.

The focus is research on secure and correct IT systems at the highest international level.

To bundle and expand knowledge and competences as well as promoting young scientists, the LIT Secure and Correct Systems Lab focusses on two main pillars:

- **Graduate School for Secure and Correct Systems.** i.e., a JKU PhD program at the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences (TNF) with a special focus on secure and correct systems.
- **Basic and applied research** with partners from industry/business and science
